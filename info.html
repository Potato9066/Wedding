                                    We would greatly appreciate that phones be put away during the ceremony so as to be in the moment with us and not distract other guest.

                                    In case of light rain there will be umbrellas provided and the ceremony will continue as planned.
                                </li>

                                    In case of inclement weather (lightning and thunderstorms), 
                                    we would be forced to move the ceremony inside the Chapel which can only seat 80 people. If this occurs we ask that you be courteous to others needs,
                                    especially if you feel you are able to stand for the 20 - 30 minute ceremony.

                                    Please watch the weather as our wedding date approaches to plan accordingly. 
                                    We will attempt to notify everyone if the schedule is changed due to the weather. 
                                    This decision will be made on 06/28/2025 by noon
